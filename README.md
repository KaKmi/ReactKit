ReactKit Sheet
=================

Time Sheet Component for React. Modified from [timesheet.js](https://github.com/sbstjn/timesheet.js)

## Demo & Examples


To build the examples locally, run:

```
npm build
http-server -p 4040
```

Then open [`localhost:4040`](http://localhost:4040) in a browser.

## Installation

The easiest way to use `ReactKit` is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [WebPack](http://webpack.github.io), etc).

```
npm install 
```
